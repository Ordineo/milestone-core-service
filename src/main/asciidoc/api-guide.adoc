[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

RESTful milestone uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not created URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
from resource to resource.
